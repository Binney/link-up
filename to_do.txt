=== TO DO

sweaton/public/javascripts/ => all google maps scripts (!!!)

Debatable solution for when a user is deleted, should any venues they have created be deleted too? (--> almost certainly yes)

add extra validity tests (character limit on description? non-blank tests on.....? Should probably be okay to allow blank description and blank postcode, since either may be non-necessary or not applicable)

Complex search

Need a picture for each venue; no idea how to upload pics, but we need capability for it. Once that's done, can be adapted into extra user avatar stuff.
--> following on from that, capability for each venue to have a gallery?
--> Related: Each venue has its own avatar. This should appear on its .show page with the same width as the side panel. For the admin on that venue it should link to a "change" page for it, shouldn't be a link for anyone else.

Make it that /signin and /signup are inaccessible when already logged in?

Calendar

Length restrictions on um everything

Different homepages for each login type (ie / looks different for each, though login pages look the same). Different colour scheme?

On Venue page, option to filter by type of event

Minimap on side of Venue page and each event

Option to show/hide New Event segment on Venue page if logged in etc (how?!)

Also, need to make it that you can create an event from scratch from inventory and it shows venues alphabetically, OR that you select New Event from the Venue page, it renders the form ON that page (...?), and doesn't give you a choice for venue - the dropdown box is concreted over with that venue on.

Re maps: hidden boolean IsMapped; kept by database. When you create a venue with no address, false. Then you enter address/postcode and look at where the Maps facility has put it in London. If that's right, you tick the box and it's saved. If it's wrong, you can manually change the location to wherever you click. THEN when minimap displays location, if IsMapped==false, it'll show a "This Venue Is Unmapped" message over the top; if true, it'll display the approved location.

When you create an event at a venue you didn't make, it needs to say so - and remind you that you can't edit its details.

Autofillers for event.new and event.edit form: automatically fills with a time and date suitable and with correct venue (as was just clicked).
Questionable: Change dropdown box so as to only show venues that are yours?

Tickboxes for tags that the event you just made has. Maybe a toggle view on Create and Edit so you can create an event quickly without needing to tag everything but can sort it out later?

On tick index: You want more characteristic data layout than just a list, so have a grid of maybe 4 across and a page down alphabetic tag names each with a nice big generic colourful picture. Each type (sport, community volunteering, art, etc) is a different colour (team sports dark blue, different sports light blue?), while unclassified ones are grey. These pictures are - like the tags - determined by Link Up and stored hard on the server. Clicking each redirects you to events for that tag.

created_at and updated_at are ready-made so as to facilitate a Feed system: especially for mentors, they can go to a user page, find out (favourites.sort_by(created_at) and attendings.sort_by(created_at)) what they've been doing chronologically.

========= NOTES ON THINGS ALREADY DONE ==========

Scatch this. Anyone with an organiser account can create an event and register it at any venue. But they can't edit the venue unless it's theirs. ?Comprende?

===== FURRIFY THIS SHNIZZLE venues.has_many(events) and events.belong_to(venues) =====

DIFFERENT USER TYPES:
1) standard student
2) parent/teacher has_many mentors (relationship model?)
3) organizer has_many venues (must be able to delete them under _venue.html.erb)
4) admin (god)

Find a way of ordering venues alphabetically REGARDLESS of who created them. How does sql alphabetic ordering work again?!?!

cba to find a validity tester for postcodes; if they can't find their own postcode it's their own bloody fault

Events have tags; venues do not
