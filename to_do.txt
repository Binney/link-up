=== TO DO

CSS: OKAY so it needs to be less repetitive! 
    1) integrate generated_css_with_orange into custom.css
    2) - OR split up the entire file, up to you
    3) Make ALL button css like the generated_... file. THEN create extra for the major buttons, plus minor buttons like Sign In or Sign Up (differ from major ones in size and border-radius=4 not 0)

Homepage map to show events occuring in the next DAY?? by venue obvs

String search function APPEARS to do ONE search but in fact carries out THREE:
1) events
2) venues
3) news items/updates

More specialised search function instead carries out ONE search on events with relevant attributes.

On event view page: link_to back to index
ditto venues

No such thing as a profile - redirects to home unless you're an admin/teacher, in which case it gives you details and Message Me link

Fourth button up top?? "Browse Categories" which gives you an index of tags in a table and lets you browse events in each tag (organised by alphabetical name)

ATTENDING SYSTEM
================

Toggled form for attending in sidebar of event view - table:
Monday | Thursday | Saturday
This   | This     | This
All    | All      | All
click to add to diary_entries

cost:string and cost:integer - former straight from doc, latter for search? (eg if it's £2.50 a sesssion but £13 annual membership, search by £2.50 not £13)

Extract tag info via final 2 columns on doc

Nicer About page a la design

Add Research page to footer+header

Functioning email verification process!!!!!

Need pictures for each venue - upload? Carrierwave? Plus default images

Make it that /signin and /signup are inaccessible when already logged in?

Option to show/hide New Event segment on Venue page if logged in etc (how?!)

Tickboxes for tags that the event you just made has. Maybe a toggle view on Create and Edit so you can create an event quickly without needing to tag everything but can sort it out later?

On tag index: You want more characteristic data layout than just a list, so have a grid of maybe 4 across and a page down alphabetic tag names each with a nice big generic colourful picture. Each type (sport, community volunteering, art, etc) is a different colour (team sports dark blue, different sports light blue?), while unclassified ones are grey. These pictures are - like the tags - determined by Link Up and stored hard on the server. Clicking each redirects you to events for that tag.

created_at and updated_at are ready-made so as to facilitate a Feed system: especially for mentors, they can go to a user page, find out (favourites.sort_by(created_at) and attendings.sort_by(created_at)) what they've been doing chronologically.

Custom pagination (details at http://thewebfellas.com/blog/2010/8/22/revisited-roll-your-own-pagination-links-with-will_paginate-and-rails-3 )

========= NOTES ON THINGS ALREADY DONE ==========


===== FURRIFY THIS SHNIZZLE venues.has_many(events) and events.belong_to(venues) =====

DIFFERENT USER TYPES:
1) standard student
2) parent/teacher has_many mentors (relationship model?)
3) organizer has_many venues (must be able to delete them under _venue.html.erb)
4) admin (god)

Find a way of ordering venues alphabetically REGARDLESS of who created them. How does sql alphabetic ordering work again?!?!

cba to find a validity tester for postcodes; if they can't find their own postcode it's their own bloody fault

Events have tags; venues do not
