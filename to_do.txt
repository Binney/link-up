=== TO DO

Need a picture for each venue; no idea how to upload pics, but we need capability for it. Once that's done, can be adapted into extra user avatar stuff.
--> following on from that, capability for each venue to have a gallery?
--> Related: Each venue has its own avatar. This should appear on its .show page with the same width as the side panel. For the admin on that venue it should link to a "change" page for it, shouldn't be a link for anyone else.

Make it that /signin and /signup are inaccessible when already logged in?

On Venue page, option to filter by type of event

Option to show/hide New Event segment on Venue page if logged in etc (how?!)

Also, need to make it that you can create an event from scratch from inventory and it shows venues alphabetically, OR that you select New Event from the Venue page, it renders the form ON that page (...?), and doesn't give you a choice for venue - the dropdown box is concreted over with that venue on.

Tickboxes for tags that the event you just made has. Maybe a toggle view on Create and Edit so you can create an event quickly without needing to tag everything but can sort it out later?

On tag index: You want more characteristic data layout than just a list, so have a grid of maybe 4 across and a page down alphabetic tag names each with a nice big generic colourful picture. Each type (sport, community volunteering, art, etc) is a different colour (team sports dark blue, different sports light blue?), while unclassified ones are grey. These pictures are - like the tags - determined by Link Up and stored hard on the server. Clicking each redirects you to events for that tag.

created_at and updated_at are ready-made so as to facilitate a Feed system: especially for mentors, they can go to a user page, find out (favourites.sort_by(created_at) and attendings.sort_by(created_at)) what they've been doing chronologically.

Space for user to custom add things to their map, eg home or school

Local venues box: Gets all venues within a certain radius of user's home address from venues_controller and displays list accordingly

Popular Near You: (really?!) well it's just a tag list I guess

Events Today: Time driven list of events in the next day, not a calendar.

When you click on tags,
    tag.show
        tab view of... (does this really go with existing design? discuss tomorrow)
        map view
        calendar view
        alphabetic list

Venue homepage: map (aside? maybe makes more sense to scroll down)
        event calendar

========= NOTES ON THINGS ALREADY DONE ==========

Scatch this. Anyone with an organiser account can create an event and register it at any venue. But they can't edit the venue unless it's theirs. ?Comprende?

===== FURRIFY THIS SHNIZZLE venues.has_many(events) and events.belong_to(venues) =====

DIFFERENT USER TYPES:
1) standard student
2) parent/teacher has_many mentors (relationship model?)
3) organizer has_many venues (must be able to delete them under _venue.html.erb)
4) admin (god)

Find a way of ordering venues alphabetically REGARDLESS of who created them. How does sql alphabetic ordering work again?!?!

cba to find a validity tester for postcodes; if they can't find their own postcode it's their own bloody fault

Events have tags; venues do not
