=== TO DO

CSS: OKAY so it needs to be less repetitive! 
    1) integrate generated_css_with_orange into custom.css
    2) - OR split up the entire file, up to you
    3) Make ALL button css like the generated_... file. THEN create extra for the major buttons, plus minor buttons like Sign In or Sign Up (differ from major ones in size and border-radius=4 not 0)

Homepage map to show events occuring in the next DAY?? by venue obvs - search for it by TIMINGS

String search function APPEARS to do ONE search but in fact carries out THREE:
1) events
2) venues
3) news items/updates

More specialised search function instead carries out ONE search on events with relevant attributes.

No such thing as a profile - redirects to home unless you're an admin/teacher, in which case it gives you details and Message Me link

Make New Event "link" styled (blue, mouse changes)

Messages button: also says in brackets number of unread messages

SEARCH: needs to redirect you to events index page when you click from homepage - how does ransack do that?!?!?

ATTENDING SYSTEM
================

Toggled form for attending in sidebar of event view - table:
Monday | Thursday | Saturday
This   | This     | This
All    | All      | All
click to add to diary_entries/favourites

Extract cost info with regex from docs?

Repopulate database with GMT times

Make sample_data recognise that gender: All and gender: Both are the same (ditto Boys vs Male and Girls vs Female)

Smaller tags image below main venue image on event Show page

Fix venue images to L logo and event images to ? or first tag by default

More links on footer (eg news)

Extract tag info via final 2 columns on doc

Nicer About page a la design

Add Research page to footer+header

Functioning email verification process!!!!!

Need pictures for each venue - upload? Carrierwave? Plus default images

Change it to Dance. Sounds better than Dancing

Make it that /signin and /signup are inaccessible when already logged in?

On tag index: You want more characteristic data layout than just a list, so have a grid of maybe 4 across and a page down alphabetic tag names each with a nice big generic colourful picture. Each type (sport, community volunteering, art, etc) is a different colour (team sports dark blue, different sports light blue?), while unclassified ones are grey. These pictures are - like the tags - determined by Link Up and stored hard on the server. Clicking each redirects you to events for that tag.

created_at and updated_at are ready-made so as to facilitate a Feed system: especially for mentors, they can go to a user page, find out (favourites.sort_by(created_at) and attendings.sort_by(created_at)) what they've been doing chronologically.

Custom pagination (details at http://thewebfellas.com/blog/2010/8/22/revisited-roll-your-own-pagination-links-with-will_paginate-and-rails-3 )
