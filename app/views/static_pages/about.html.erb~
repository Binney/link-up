<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>Link-up is designed to connect secondary school students with opportunities which will develop them socially, intellectually, emotionally and creatively.
​ 
We want to bring students together with teachers, youth organisations, businesses and charities in order to enhance the life chances of the next generation.We will provide resources, support, guidance and training for schools who wish to broaden the horizons of their students outside of the classroom.</p>

<b>Research</b>
<br>
<p>Research has shown that students who partake in extra-curricular activities, whether that be sports, drama, volunteering or work, develop resilience (Oliver et al, 2006), higher than expected grades (Eccles 2003), school value (i.e. perception of importance of school for the future) and  self-esteem (Fredericks, 2008).
​ <br>
Research has also shown that students from disadvantaged backgrounds:
​<br>
<li>a. fall behind their more privileged peers in terms of university entrance. This is due to their lack wider experience and the way they present themselves in their personal statements (Jones, 2012 on behalf of the Sutton Trust), not because of their academic attainment.</li>
<li>b. fall behind their more privileged peers in the world of work. Although the state-school-educated graduates  outperform those from public schools (88% to 85% receiving 2,1 or 1st class degrees), only 58% of state-school-educated graduates find a professional job, compared to 74% of independently educated graduates in the same period (Bristol University, 2013). This is often due to a lack of the ‘softer’ non -academic skills required to succeed in interviews and assessment centres.</li>
