<h2>Finding events</h2>
<p>You can search from the homepage to find events near you or with a certain category. Or <%= link_to "browse events", events_path %> to search by time, cost, gender, and so on. You can also <%= link_to "browse by category", tags_path %>.</p>
<h2>Your diary</h2>
<p>You can create a diary of all the events you want to attend and you'll get a reminder when they're on. Hit "Add to Diary" on an event and it'll get added to your diary for that week, or "Favourite" to add it every week.</p>
<h2>I run a club/society that I'd like to put on the site! How can I upgrade my account?</h2>
<p><a href="mailto:help@link-up.org.uk">Email us</a> at Link Up and we'll upgrade your account. As an Event Organiser you can create events and advertise them. Or if you'd just like one listing added, we can just put that up ourselves without upgrading you.<p>
