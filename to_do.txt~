=== TO DO

CSS: OKAY so it needs to be less repetitive! 
    1) integrate generated_css_with_orange into custom.css
    2) - OR split up the entire file, up to you

Fix the whole "avatar_for" thing. Venues need pics, end of.

Messages button: also says in brackets number of unread messages

Extract cost info with regex from docs?

Fix venue images to L logo

Tag index page: a) left column ftw b) every two-line name gets split between TWO circles - fix!! (Line height for li != line height for text)

Add Research+News page to footer+header

Need pictures for each venue - upload? Carrierwave? Plus default images

Make it that /signin and /signup are inaccessible when already logged in?

created_at and updated_at are ready-made so as to facilitate a Feed system: especially for mentors, they can go to a user page, find out (favourites.sort_by(created_at) and attendings.sort_by(created_at)) what they've been doing chronologically.

Custom pagination (details at http://thewebfellas.com/blog/2010/8/22/revisited-roll-your-own-pagination-links-with-will_paginate-and-rails-3 )

^ Following on from this, possibly (on signup page) an infowindow/dialog pops up to tell you what you stand to gain and lose by selecting a school.

HTTP requests for :admin=>true ??!!

Make Upcoming Events and Past Events a) paginate b) appear in date order (or weekday?)

Switch to Unicorn and ensure it works (WEBrick is not cool apparently :| )

FORGOT YOUR PASSWORD?????

======================== FUTURE STUFF =========================

* Reviews (can be posted by anyone but I'd expect mainly students)

* News (can be posted by organisers and mentors)

* Related Events: eg if there's an event (Parkour Generations eg) which is run at multiple venues, this'll show the link
