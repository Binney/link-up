=== TO DO

CSS: OKAY so it needs to be less repetitive! 
    1) integrate generated_css_with_orange into custom.css
    2) - OR split up the entire file, up to you
    3) Make ALL button css like the generated_... file. THEN create extra for the major buttons, plus minor buttons like Sign In or Sign Up (differ from major ones in size and border-radius=4 not 0)

Homepage map to show events occuring in the next DAY?? by venue obvs - search for it by TIMINGS

String search function APPEARS to do ONE search but in fact carries out THREE:
1) events
2) venues
3) news items/updates

More specialised search function instead carries out ONE search on events with relevant attributes.

No such thing as a profile - redirects to home unless you're an admin/teacher, in which case it gives you details and Message Me link

Make New Event "link" styled (blue, mouse changes)

Messages button: also says in brackets number of unread messages

ATTENDING SYSTEM
================

Toggled form for attending in sidebar of event view - table:
Monday | Thursday | Saturday
This   | This     | This
All    | All      | All
click to add to diary_entries/favourites

Extract cost info with regex from docs?

Repopulate database with GMT times

Make sample_data recognise that gender: All and gender: Both are the same (ditto Boys vs Male and Girls vs Female)

"Various Venues" should get deleted automatically but Other Venue gets the address and postcode of #10 Downing Street so it will appear roughly in the middle of the map

Smaller tags image below main venue image on event Show page

Fix venue images to L logo and event images to ? or first tag by default

More links on footer (eg news)

Extract tag info via final 2 columns on doc

Nicer About page a la design

Add Research page to footer+header

Functioning email verification process!!!!!

Need pictures for each venue - upload? Carrierwave? Plus default images

Make it that /signin and /signup are inaccessible when already logged in?

Potentially make all tabs of constant height? They paginate but don't make whatever's beneath them move up and down. Mainly thinking of my_events here.

created_at and updated_at are ready-made so as to facilitate a Feed system: especially for mentors, they can go to a user page, find out (favourites.sort_by(created_at) and attendings.sort_by(created_at)) what they've been doing chronologically.

Custom pagination (details at http://thewebfellas.com/blog/2010/8/22/revisited-roll-your-own-pagination-links-with-will_paginate-and-rails-3 )

SCHOOLS: Each user has a School, which may or may not be filled (string as a name). By selecting your school, you can view events at the venue which is that school, but you also can be viewed by any MENTORS at that school (which you can tell by them ALSO having the school string set). Each school involved in the project gets its own venue, which may (eg Dagenham) actually have events listed or (Westminster) may simply be a placeholder. Users have addresses which by default are set to their school's but they can change this via their profile (by selecting their school on the Signup page it fills in the address box with the school's address but they can then swap it). Or you can leave School blank in which case you're left to geocode yourself (default: #10 Downing Street)

^ Following on from this, possibly (on signup page) an infowindow/dialog pops up to tell you what you stand to gain and lose by selecting a school.

IT ISN'T CALCULATING TIMING.DAY CORRECTLY or summat - see on_today

HTML requests for :admin=>true ??!!

======================== FUTURE STUFF =========================

* Reviews (can be posted by anyone but I'd expect mainly students)

* News (can be posted by organisers and mentors)

* Related Events: eg if there's an event (Parkour Generations eg) which is run at multiple venues, this'll show the link
