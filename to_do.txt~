=== TO DO

Cancan can you do the cancan (interpret "can" in the imperative rather than the question form here)

CSS: OKAY so it needs to be less repetitive! 
    1) integrate generated_css_with_orange into custom.css
    2) - OR split up the entire file, up to you

Fix the whole "avatar_for" thing. Venues need pics, end of.

Extract cost info with regex from docs?

Fix venue images to L logo

Tag index page: a) left column ftw b) every two-line name gets split between TWO circles - fix!! (Line height for li != line height for text)

Add Research+News page to footer+header

Need pictures for each venue - upload? Carrierwave? Plus default images

Make it that /signin and /signup are inaccessible when already logged in?

created_at and updated_at are ready-made so as to facilitate a Feed system: especially for mentors, they can go to a user page, find out (favourites.sort_by(created_at) and attendings.sort_by(created_at)) what they've been doing chronologically.

Custom pagination (details at http://thewebfellas.com/blog/2010/8/22/revisited-roll-your-own-pagination-links-with-will_paginate-and-rails-3 )

^ Following on from this, possibly (on signup page) an infowindow/dialog pops up to tell you what you stand to gain and lose by selecting a school.

HTTP requests for :admin=>true ??!!

Make Upcoming Events and Past Events a) paginate b) appear in date order (or weekday?)

# Confirmation stages:
#
# 0: Created by mentor
# 1: Confirmed by mentee but not admin
# 2: Confirmed by admin but not mentee
# 3: Confirmed by both and thus valid

You should be able to send messages to your teachers too. So under "new message" we need a contact list including admin, mentors, mentees, and anyone who's ever messaged you (nb mentors automatically fall into this group) so teachers have to message the kids first BUT then either can email the other.

Argue: separate role for "mentor"? Pros: yr 7s can't request other yr 7s; cons: need to swap everthing around in 3 years. For now, just the one.

======================== FUTURE STUFF =========================

* Reviews (can be posted by anyone but I'd expect mainly students)

* News (can be posted by organisers and mentors)

* Related Events: eg if there's an event (Parkour Generations eg) which is run at multiple venues, this'll show the link

* Log of popularity IE how many people have a) attended b) favourited each event for a) "popular near you" and b) event organisers to advertise
^ Following on: different colour schemes for more/less popular ones: gradual gradient between $orange (popular) and $yellow (less so)
