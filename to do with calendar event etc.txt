Calendar, events, diary entries etc
===================================

HOW ABOUT
Events have potentially MULTIPLE start and end times SO

1) Diary entries have an event_id attribute. No has_many or belongs_to link, but instead it just serves to identify the name, description, venue etc info.
2) When you click Join Event, it adds the next instance of that event to your diary, except if there are multiples in which case it aaaaaaaaaaaargh gives you an option?
--> when you click Join you get a page which has 3 buttons each of which adds that instance of the event to your calendar??? NO IDEA
3) Events have an array of start_ and end_times (yes this will require extra added FUN by which I mean migration)
4) need to have option to Favourite ie add all instances of it to your calendar - or should it just add it to a list?

Basically:
a) How should you be able to pick between different instances of the same event?
b) What's the deal on past events, how can they be verified?

Ask on friday!!!
