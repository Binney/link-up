Pages to make ========

Space for user to custom add things to their map, eg home or school

IMPORTANT: User's home address - at first from ip then they type it in? migration needed

Local venues box: Gets all venues within a certain radius of user's home address from venues_controller and displays list accordingly

Popular Near You: (really?!) well it's just a tag list I guess

Events Today: Time driven list of events in the next day, not a calendar.

When you click on tags,
    tag.show
        tab view of... (does this really go with existing design? discuss tomorrow)
        map view
        calendar view
        alphabetic list

Venue homepage: map (aside? maybe makes more sense to scroll down)
        event calendar
