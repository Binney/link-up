ON THE SUBJECT OF THE DEFAULT SEARCH BAR VISIBLE FROM HOMEPAGE
==============================================================

1) Postcode entered but no activities: Index all events sorted by proximity. Yes, this means effectively sorting VENUES by location and then sub-indexing their events by date (I guess?) and then putting them in clusters. That's okay.

2) Activity entered but no postcode. Index all events with that tag by date.

3) Both entered. Index all events with that tag by proximity.

Does this mean I need an entire extra database column titled Proximity which gets deleted after each search? As a float, how far it is from you? Inefficient! Must be possible to make Ransack take a temporary search key its proximity from you?!

Actually, entering only postcode isn't a search at all. Eff it, you don't even need Ransack for any of these.

1) is a simple index sort.
2) is Tag.view
3) is Tag.view with a different sort.

Huh.
